# Basic Loaf (7/4/2013)

I figure I haven't baked bread in a while. Conveniently chose to bake in
the middle of a heat wave with no AC.

## Formula

 * Flour -- 100% -- 500g
 * Water -- 70% -- 350g
 * Yeast -- 1% -- 5g
 * Salt -- 2% -- 10g

 * Yield: 1 loaf

## Technique

### Mix

Preferment: 100g water, 100g flour, pinch of salt. Room temperature for
one hour. Add remaining ingredients.

### Knead

Stand mixer.

### Rise

Room temperature for one hour. Overnight in the fridge. Remove from
fridge for one hour.

### Proof

Basic boule.

### Bake

500F, 5mins. 475F, 25mins. Pan of water next to baking stone.

## Notes

Taste is solid. Crumb is a little dense. Oven spring was minimal, loaf
was a little flat.
